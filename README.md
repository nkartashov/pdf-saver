What do you do when you see an interesting paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org)? I save it to [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/)!
Unfortunately, some of the papers when saved look like this
![Without PDF saver](https://github.com/nkartashov/pdf-saver/raw/master/images/screenshots/without_pdf_saver.png "1703... whaaat?")  


Easy to guess that this is "Generalization and Equilibrium in Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs)", right?
I don't think so either, so PDF saver is here to save you that precious time for actually reading the paper!
Install the PDF saver extension from [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pdf-saver/nnopjfgdbhajdicjliimdmmgkkkljlnc) and your papers
will look like this
