PDF saver
=========
Icon pending

The simplest ever Chrome extension for saving PDFs to [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) intended mostly for use with [arXiv](https://arxiv.org).

Pocket doesn't really parse PDF metainfo, so we do it for you, just click on the extension's icon and save the much needed time remembering what 1703.01161.pdf mean.
